how a hash table works? 
How to choose a good hash function? 
How to handle collisions, 
and when to resize the table?

Problem of the week
We're having so much fun this week with hash tables already, why stop!

For this week, take a stab at implementing a hash table in your favorite programming language. That is to say, write a data structure that will let you map keys to values and give you amortized constant-time access. Your implementation should have some form of collision handling--what do you do when your hash function maps two keys to the same place?
